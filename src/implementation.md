## Immediate Next Steps

### Priority 1: Q CLI Data Extraction (This Week)

**Goal**: Build tooling to extract Q CLI conversation data into a common format for review and analysis.

1. **Locate and examine Q CLI database**:
   ```bash
   # Find Q CLI database location
   find ~ -name "*.db" -path "*q*" 2>/dev/null
   # Examine schema and understand data structure
   sqlite3 <database_path> ".schema"
   sqlite3 <database_path> "SELECT name FROM sqlite_master WHERE type='table';"
   ```

2. **Build extraction utility**:
   - Export complete conversation transcripts
   - Include all context (system prompts, tool descriptions, file states)
   - Create clean, reviewable format (JSON + markdown summaries)
   - Preserve timestamps and session boundaries

3. **Design common format**:
   - Standardized conversation structure
   - Metadata about context and configuration
   - Easy to read for manual review
   - Structured for automated analysis later

**Deliverables**:

- **Pattern detection accuracy**: Continuous validation against human judgment
- **Scalability issues**: Design for incremental processing and analysis

### Methodological Risks
- **Gaming the metrics**: Focus on underlying quality, not just measurable proxies
- **Overfitting to specific use cases**: Test across diverse tasks and contexts
- **Subjective quality measures**: Establish clear criteria and multiple validation approaches

### Resource Risks
- **Analysis complexity**: Start simple and add sophistication incrementally
- **Data volume**: Build efficient processing pipelines from the start
- **Maintenance burden**: Design for automation and minimal manual intervention

This implementation plan provides a concrete roadmap for building the AI experience evaluation system while maintaining flexibility to adapt based on what we learn along the way.
